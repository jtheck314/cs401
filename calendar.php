<?php $pageName = "calendar"; ?>
<?php require_once "header.php"; ?>

<div class="calendar">
 <img src="img/calendar.png"/>
 <p>I heard mentioned in class that the best way to do the calendar was with javascript. The enventual goal for this page would be to have appointment time that users can sign up for. As I learn the tools to make that happen I will integrate them into this page.</p>
</div>

<?php require_once "footer.php"; ?>
